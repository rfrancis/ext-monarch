# ext-monarch
Chrome extension for quick enabling/disabling extensions per browser instance

Rule over your extensions with, well, rules. Determine what will or will not be enabled on this browser instance!

There are several extension managers out there, but all of them did both more than I needed and also not what I needed, which is to have a simple set of rules that say "enable this, disable this" that are local to a browser.  Why?  Because syncing what's enabled is ridiculous, especially once you own a Chromebook.  I don't need all those apps on my desktop browser, thanks.

Anyway, this is VERY early in the works -- like, I started it less than 24 hours ago as of this writing -- and it's definitely not in the app store yet.  Use at your own risk.  But I would totally love some collaboration or even just your commentary.  That's why my repo's here!

Oh, right, how to use.  Pretty simple once you have the extension installed.  Click the icon -- uh, lack of icon, just an E really for now -- and you get a popup listing all your extensions.  Click the box in the Y column to tell it you want that extension explicitly enabled, the N column to tell it you want it explicitly disabled, and leave them both blank if you want it to leave that extension be.  Click Save after making changes.  Click Execute to apply the rules.  That's pretty much it!  If you right-click on the non-icon, you can do Execute without the popup -- useful for when you've got everything set up and you come to your browser and all your ChromeOS apps are enabled again because of dumb old sync.  Right-click, Execute Rules, boom.  Just like that.

Enjoy,\
