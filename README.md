# ext-monarch
Chrome extension for quick enabling/disabling extensions per browser instance

Rule over your extensions with, well, rules. Determine what will or will not be enabled on this browser instance!

There are several extension managers out there, but all of them did both more than I needed and also not what I needed, which is to have a simple set of rules that say "enable this, disable this" that are local to a browser.  Why?  Because syncing what's enabled is ridiculous, especially once you own a Chromebook.  I don't need all those apps on my desktop browser, thanks.

Anyway, this is VERY early in the works -- like, I started it less than 24 hours ago as of this writing -- and it's definitely not in the app store yet.  Use at your own risk.  But I would totally love some collaboration or even just your commentary.  That's why my repo's here!

Cheers,\
R
